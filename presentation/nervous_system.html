        If you think of the human body, what does our nervous system let us do? It lets us hear, see, take input. 
        It lets us think and analyze and plan. It lets us make decisions and communicate and take action. 
        Every company essentially has a nervous system: companies take inputs, they think, they plan, they communicate, they take action. 
        The question is how does the nervous system in your company operate? 
        Is the IT infrastructure really adding value?
